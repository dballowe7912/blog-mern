# ChatterHead

Built based off of the [Untree](https://untree.co) template "Blogy" template which is available through [Theme Wagon](https://themewagon.com).

Created using the MERN stack, A blog app which will be used to create blogs by admins and read by users. Content will be able to be created by the admins, with users being able to comment and reply.
